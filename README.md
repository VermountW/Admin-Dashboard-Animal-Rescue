# Animal Rescue System - Admin Dashboard

## Overview
The **Animal Rescue System** is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the process of reporting and rescuing animals in distress. It consists of three main components:

- **[Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/VermountW/Admin-Dashboard-Animal-Rescue)** - The UI for administrators to review and update the status of reported animal cases.
- **[Server (Backend)](https://github.com/VermountW/Back-End-Animal-Rescue)** - The backend system that manages data and communication between users and administrators.
- **[User App](https://github.com/VermountW/UserApp-Animal-Rescue)** - The frontend application for users to report animal anomalies and track their case status.

This repository contains the **Admin Dashboard**, which serves as the central hub for managing animal rescue operations. **This project is designed to run locally and does not include a hosted deployment.**
