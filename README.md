# Animal Rescue System - Admin Dashboard

## Overview
The **Animal Rescue System** is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the process of reporting and rescuing animals in distress. It consists of three main components:
- **Admin Dashboard** - The UI for administrators to review and update the status of reported animal cases.
- **Server** - The backend system that manages data, authentication, and communication between users and administrators.
- **User Report App** - The frontend application for users to report animal anomalies and track their case status.

This repository contains the **Admin Dashboard**, which serves as the central hub for managing animal rescue operations.

## Features
